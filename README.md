```
### How to use
```
There are 2 ways to use get the .txt file.
1. Using NTNU_CP2_2024_bot developed by me.
  Check the command list in order to know the bot's command.

  (tja to txt source code will be hidden until semester ended)
2. You can download the python source code if you want to try it yourself.

you can try to use diff (in linux) or compare-object (in Windows PowerShell)
to check if your answer are correct or not.
